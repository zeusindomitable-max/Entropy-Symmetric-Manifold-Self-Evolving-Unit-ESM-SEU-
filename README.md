### About the Author

My name is **Hari Hardiyan**, an independent researcher from Indonesia.
I am not a professional physicist or mathematician — I simply love to explore how mathematics, information theory, and artificial intelligence might share the same hidden symmetry.
This work is a personal effort to express that connection in a clear, open, and humble way.

### Motivation

In many machine learning systems, models often become unstable when their gradients, parameters, or entropy interactions become too chaotic.
The idea behind **ESM–SEU** is simple:

> Every intelligent system evolves by balancing *entropy* and *symmetry* — not by force, but by self-consistency.

From this intuition, the **ESM (Entropy Symmetric Manifold)** and **SEU (Self-Evolving Unit)** were born.
Together, they form a mathematical structure that describes how a learning system can *stabilize itself* while still *adapting* to new data.

### Simplified Mathematical Form

The full theoretical form of ESM–SEU can be complex, but its core principle can be expressed simply as:

```
E_SEU = d/dt [ H(x) + λ * S(x) ] - ∇ · Φ(x, θ)
```

Where:

* `H(x)` = entropy component (information uncertainty)
* `S(x)` = symmetry preservation term (self-balance)
* `Φ(x, θ)` = flow of adaptation or parameter evolution
* `λ` = coupling strength between entropy and symmetry

This means that a learning process is not purely gradient descent —
it is a **balance between disorder (entropy)** and **structure (symmetry)**,
which continuously evolves toward a stable manifold of intelligence.

### Intuitive Explanation

* **For physicists:** it behaves like a *field equation* of self-organizing information, where entropy and symmetry seek equilibrium.
* **For ML engineers:** it works as an adaptive regularizer that reduces oscillation and gradient explosion during training.
* **For general readers:** it is a way to make AI learn more naturally — by keeping itself stable while evolving.

### Future Work

The next step is to build small experiments showing how ESM–SEU stabilizes the training of simple neural networks compared to Adam or SGD.
Even a small improvement in convergence smoothness would validate the core hypothesis:

> Stability can emerge naturally when entropy and symmetry evolve together.
